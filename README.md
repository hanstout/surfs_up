* The highest recorded temp is 85 degrees
* The lowest recorded temp is 64 degrees

December Temperatures
* The average temp is 71 degrees
* The highest recorded temp is 83 degrees
* The lowest recorded temp is 56 degrees
# Summary: 
The month of June is optimal for both ice cream and surfing when looking at temperatures. The lowest recorded temperature is 64 degrees, which is cooler, but the average is still a high enough temeperature to enjoy both activities. The month of December is less optimal than the month of June, but has the possibility to make money on warmer days. The lowest temperature being 56 degrees would not be an ideal day for surfing and may lead to less ice cream cravings, it would still be worth being open because the temperature average is still warm enough to enjoy activites, especially considering there was a high of 83 degrees recorded. More queries could be ran to better determine of this business should run year-round. One additional query could show results of precipitation. If precipitation is high in these months, then that could affect customer outcomes. Another additional query could show results of different stations. Looking at the stations could predict if these months would bring in money and which locations would bring in more or less money. Taking a look at stations would allow the owner to try out year-round openings in certain locations. 
Overall, both June and December have potential to make money and allow for a year-round business based on the data.
